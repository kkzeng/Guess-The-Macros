# Guess-The-Macros
A Java-based game that scrapes the nutritional information of food off of the USDA database and allows users to guess and 
learn the nutritional content of foods to help people make healthier food choices and understand that food is not "good"
and "bad" but rather the amounts in which we consume it.

Uses Jsoup to scrape

*Deprecated now - USDA updated the format of their website. Will work on updating the scraping section when I get to updating the app.
